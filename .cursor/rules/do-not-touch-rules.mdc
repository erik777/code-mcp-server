- Never remove `<link>`, `<script>`, or `<meta>` tags from `index.html` unless explicitly asked.
- Never delete unused sections like `devDependenciesOld` or `optionalDependencies` unless instructed.
- Avoid deleting legacy animations, font references, or global includesâ€”these may still be in use outside Vite scope.
- Always confirm before removing anything that looks unused or unclear.
- Never revert a git commit made by the user unless explicitly told to do so.  Ask the user if you think it can help.  
- Do not edit or delete any `.env.local.*` files.
